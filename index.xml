      <description>Hi
I am Keerthana! By day I convert coffee into code for training robots at Google Brain. I can talk endlessly about artificial intelligence, robotics and self-driving. I am also passionate about investing and stock markets, entrepreneurship, fitness, public policy in India and gender equality. A part of my day is spent playing with my pug puppy Kiwi, who is monstrosity and innocence rolled into one. I live in San Francisco and in my free time I love to read, write, work out, ski, photograph and play board games.</description>
